WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net btn_tick is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <rx_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
DRC detected 0 errors and 2 warnings.
